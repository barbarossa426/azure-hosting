# Azure hosting
As a developer, you may already know that Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services, including hosting web applications, databases, and virtual machines. Hosting on Azure is an excellent option for developers because it provides a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective way to host your applications. In this article, we will discuss some common knowledge on how to host on Azure.

## Choose the Right Azure Service
Before you start hosting your application on Azure, you need to choose the right Azure service. Azure offers a wide range of services, including Azure App Service, Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure Functions, among others. Each service has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you should choose the one that best suits your application’s requirements.

* Create a Resource Group
Once you have chosen the right Azure service, the next step is to create a resource group. A resource group is a logical container that holds related resources for an application. When you create a resource group, you can manage all the resources associated with your application in a single place.

* Create a Web App
After creating a resource group, you can create a web app or a virtual machine. If you are hosting a web application, you can use Azure App Service to create a web app. Azure App Service provides a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. If you are hosting an application that requires more control over the underlying infrastructure, you can use Azure Virtual Machines to create a virtual machine.

* Configure Your Application
After creating your web app or virtual machine, you need to configure your application. If you are hosting a web application, you can use Azure App Service to deploy your application code. Azure App Service supports a wide range of programming languages, including .NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, and Python, among others. If you are hosting a virtual machine, you need to install and configure the necessary software and libraries on the virtual machine.

* Secure Your Application
Security is critical when hosting applications on the cloud. Azure provides a wide range of security features to protect your applications from cyber threats. You can use Azure Security Center to monitor and protect your resources from cyber threats. You can also use Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage cryptographic keys, certificates, and secrets used by your application.

* Monitor Your Application
After deploying your application on Azure, you need to monitor it to ensure it is performing optimally. Azure provides a wide range of monitoring and logging tools, including Azure Application Insights, Azure Log Analytics, and Azure Monitor, among others. These tools provide real-time insights into the performance and health of your application.

In conclusion, hosting on Azure provides developers with a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective way to host their applications. By following these common knowledge steps, you can quickly and easily deploy your application on Azure and start taking advantage of the platform’s powerful features.
